Career Plans 

      ___ 🌱 The main reason for me wanting to pursue this type of role for my future career is because I learnt structure within Web Development through the Fullstack                  JavaScript course at CodeSpace. I started my programming journey at UWC doing C#, but since i was a new recruit to coding it was super tough for me to                      fullygrasp everything. I hope to make my own website in the near future and continue on to fully undestand WEB DEVELOPMENT, especially expanding onto GAME                  DEVELOPMENT.
